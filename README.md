# "eco-terra" Machine Learning App
An image identification app aimed to help those in agriculture to identify plant diseases and species.

Using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python to create the neural network that classifies input images. Then using FastAPI I created a high-performance API. Lastly, I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React to create the front-end web application.
